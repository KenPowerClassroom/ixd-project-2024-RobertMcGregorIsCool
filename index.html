        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the introduction of my interaction design project, focused on gamifying a learning app. Our aim is to make the learning experience more engaging and interactive for our users.</p>
        <p>Gamification involves applying game design principles to non-game contexts, such as education. The objective is to increase user motification, engagement and enjoyment.</p>
        <p>This project involved various phases, including a competitive analysis, wireframing, prototyping and usability testing. The competitive analysis will help me to identify strengths and weaknesses in the existing market, and highlight areas we can improve.</p>
        <p>Wireframing and prototyping allowed us to design and develop the interface and user experience of the app, ensuring that the user's needs are met.</p>
        <p>Overall, our aim is to create a learning app that is not only effective but also enjoyable, ultimately improving the user's learning outcomes.</p>
