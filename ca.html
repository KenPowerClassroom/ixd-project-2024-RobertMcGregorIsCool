              <td>Engagement: How engaging is the app? Is it visually appealing? Does it have sound and animation to capture the user’s attention? Does it have a good balance of challenge and reward? </td>
              <td style = "background-color:lightgreen;">Clean, fresh colour scheme – breezy (counter to where you think of sitting to type).  Clouds scud across header – particles, jumping, spinning. The introductory exercises provide a good onramp for learning how to type. (9/10)</td>
              <td style = "background-color:gold;">Clean, professional, a bit dull. No immediate animation – looks static, a little bland. Green progress bar animates while user is performing ‘learning’ task. You are provided with ‘lives’, which you lose on wrong answers – creates anxiety! (6/10)</td>
              <td style = "background-color:lightgreen;">Lots of well-produced animation in the header – dynamic, engaging! Strong colour scheme, with bright crisp colours. Feels a little more 'serious' than 'welcoming'. ‘Missions’ have music and sound effects while being played. Optional text to speech. (8/10) </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Progress tracking: How well does the app track the user’s progress? Does it provide feedback and recommendations to help users improve their performance? Does it use data to personalise the learning experience? </td>
              <td style = "background-color:lightgreen;">Tracks average speed, accuracy and typing time, breaking these stats down over time. It provides a daily goal, with games, tests and achievements to encourage better performance. User typing data used to make user feel valued. (8/10)</td>
              <td style = "background-color:gold;">Tracks streaks, Presents user with current progress on multiple courses. Demonstrates recent achievements. On course page, automatically scrolls to latest lesson. Displays completed lesson with green tick. Does not feel personalised. (7/10)</td>
              <td style = "background-color:lightgreen;">Missions have their own Achievement Badges and a Political Reputation status indicator. Branching story points prompts the user to reflect on the narrative and development of their in-game character and keywords, though it doesn’t seem to track user-specific data. (8/10)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>User experience: How user-friendly is the app? Is it easy to navigate and use? Does it have clear instructions and prompts? Does it have a well-designed interface? </td>
                <td style = "background-color:lightgreen;">Immediately obvious from the home page which exercises are available and which actions would be most suited to a new user. Activities come with explanatory videos. Interface is clean and inviting. Auto screen-reader! (9/10) </td>
                <td style = "background-color:gold;">Immediately puts an ad in front of user on home screen. On course page, continually encourages user to pay for AI-generated practice. If you fail a question, it animates an ad to pay for AI generated answers. (6/10) </td>
                <td style = "background-color:lightgreen;">No account required to get started – you can be into a ‘mission’ within three clicks of the starting page. Instructions are clear and options are obvious and labeled. Gameplay follows well-established visual novel conventions. (8/10)</td>
